## **Overview**

Modern wireless networks integrate deep learning models for crucial operations like **channel estimation**. These models, however, are vulnerable to **adversarial attacks**, which can drastically degrade performance by manipulating inputs. This project provides a comprehensive solution:

1. Implementation of common adversarial attack strategies.
2. A robust mitigation strategy using **defensive distillation**.
3. Detailed evaluation of performance metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**.

## **Key Features**

- **Simulation of Adversarial Attacks**:
  - Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
  - Basic Iterative Method (BIM)
  - Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
  - Momentum Iterative Method (MIM)
  - Carlini & Wagner (C&W)

- **Defensive Distillation for Mitigation**:
  - Knowledge transfer from teacher models to student models to build robust defenses.

- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Detailed metrics and visualizations for:
    - MSE (model accuracy under attack conditions).
    - ASR (success rate of adversarial attacks).

- **Dataset**:
  - Generated using MATLAB's 5G Toolbox, designed specifically for channel estimation in SISO configurations.

## **Architecture**

The overall workflow includes:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: MATLAB's 5G Toolbox generates channel estimation data with varied parameters (e.g., SNR, Doppler shift).
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train a CNN-based channel estimation model.
   - Implement teacher-student framework for defensive distillation.
3. **Adversarial Attack Simulation**:
   - Generate adversarial examples using attack methods (e.g., FGSM, PGD).
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare undefended and defended models under attack.

## **Adversarial Attacks**

| **Attack Type**  | **Description**                                                                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FGSM             | Generates adversarial examples by perturbing inputs along the gradient of the loss function.      |
| BIM              | Iterative version of FGSM, allowing for stronger attacks with higher perturbations.               |
| PGD              | Randomized, iterative attack known for high effectiveness.                                        |
| MIM              | Adds momentum to BIM for faster convergence and higher effectiveness.                            |
| C&W              | Optimization-based attack targeting minimal perturbation distance for maximal misclassification.  |

## **Defensive Distillation**

### **Key Idea**

- Train a **teacher model** using high-temperature softmax.
- Distill its knowledge into a **student model**, making it less sensitive to perturbations.

### **Advantages**

- Reduces gradient impact on adversarial inputs.
- Provides robust predictions under attack scenarios.

---

## **Performance Metrics**

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures prediction accuracy.
- **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Proportion of successful adversarial samples.

---

## **Results**

### **Key Observations**

- Adversarial attacks like **BIM**, **MIM**, and **PGD** are the most effective, with ASR reaching **0.9** under high attack power.
- **Defensive distillation** reduces ASR significantly (e.g., from **0.9** to **0.06** for BIM).

### **Sample Metrics**

| Model        | MSE (Benign) | MSE (Adversarial) | ASR (ε = 3.0) |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Undefended   | 0.02766      | 0.306523          | 0.904284      |
| Defended     | 0.02785      | 0.02918           | 0.066460      |
